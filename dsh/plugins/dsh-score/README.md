## Compatibility

| Component | Version |
|---|---|
| DeepSeek Harness | **`dsh-v0.1.5-rc.2`** (GitHub tag; verified 2026-09-11: type gates, unit/assembly suites, artifact build). Published npm line `0.1.5-rc.2` (npm `latest`/`next` are `0.1.5-rc.2`; peer dependencies `>=0.1.2-rc.1 <0.2.0 \|\| >=0.1.5-alpha.1 <0.2.0`) |
| Node.js | `^22.19.0 \|\| >=24.0.0` |
| Package manager | `pnpm@11.7.0` |
| Platform | Windows / macOS / Linux (host-only plugin) |
| External tools | `gh` CLI on PATH (authenticated for API reads), `npm` CLI on PATH |

## What you get

- `score` tool — one target through the five-dimension pipeline; returns the structured risk card, or `{ kind: 'background', jobId }` with `background: true`.
- `/score` command — batch scoring of a whitespace/comma-separated target list as a `score-batch` background job over `ctx.jobs`, producing a leaderboard snapshot (JSON + Markdown).
- `score_report` tool — fetch any stored score card (`sc_...`), leaderboard (`lb_...`), or the latest leaderboard.
- `score_badge` tool — an embeddable README badge (shields.io flat SVG + endpoint URL) and the five-dimension JSON for one scored target.
- **Five dimensions** (weights configurable, defaults sum to 100): install success `25`, maintenance `20`, documentation `20`, security `20`, compliance `15`.
- **Evidence discipline** — every dimension records its audit links (`source`, sanitized `detail`, `observedAt`); a dimension without evidence reports `no-evidence` (score 0, excluded from the weighted total), never a fabricated number.
- Structured results — every record carries `schema: "dsh-score/v1"` with first-class fields; this is the machine-readable contract downstream tooling consumes.

## Quick start

### Git channel

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add github:PerryLink/dsh-score#<commit-sha>
```

The first `add` fails because pnpm blocks the package's `prepare` build; copy the exact key pnpm printed into the profile's `pnpm-workspace.yaml` and re-run:

```yaml
allowBuilds:
  'dsh-score': true
```

### npm channel

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-score
```

Prebuilt packages need no build allowance. Restart the profile, then use `score` / `/score` from a session.

## Install & uninstall

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-score     # install (npm) — or the git form above
dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-score  # uninstall
```

## Configuration

All keys are optional (defaults shown); invalid values fail loudly at load.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `probeTimeoutMs` | `60000` | Deadline for one `gh`/`npm` probe command. |
| `outputTailBytes` | `8000` | Cap on the sanitized output tail recorded per probe. |
| `cacheMaxAgeMs` | `86400000` | How long a cached score card is reused before re-scoring (0 disables the cache). |
| `staleCommitWarnDays` | `90` | Commit/publish age at which maintenance drops to `warn`. |
| `staleCommitFailDays` | `365` | Commit/publish age at which maintenance drops to `fail`. |
| `staleIssueWarnDays` | `30` | Oldest-open-issue age (response proxy) at which maintenance drops to `warn`. |
| `staleIssueFailDays` | `180` | Oldest-open-issue age at which maintenance drops to `fail`. |
| `maxBatchTargets` | `20` | `/score` batch cap. |
| `batchConcurrency` | `1` | Batch concurrency (serial avoids API-rate contention). |
| `weights` | `{install:25, maintenance:20, documentation:20, security:20, compliance:15}` | Per-dimension weights (each 0–100; at least one must be > 0). |

## Tools & surfaces

### `score`

```
score(target: string, refresh?: boolean, background?: boolean)
```

- `target` — a GitHub repo (`github:owner/repo`, `owner/repo`, a git/https URL) or an npm package name.
- `refresh: true` bypasses the score cache and re-gathers evidence.
- `background: true` starts a `score-batch` job and returns its id.

### `/score <targets...>`

Starts one background batch job; progress streams through the job output, and the final line names the leaderboard id for `score_report`.

### `score_report(id?)`

Returns a score card (`sc_...`), a leaderboard (`lb_...`), or — with no id — the latest leaderboard.

### `score_badge(target? | id?, refresh?)`

Generates an embeddable README badge and the five-dimension JSON for one target:

- `target` — score a GitHub repo or npm package (through the cache) and badge it; mutually exclusive with `id`.
- `id` — badge a stored score card (`sc_...`) without re-scoring.
- `refresh: true` — bypass the score cache (only applies to `target`).

Returns the badge (SVG + endpoint + Markdown embed) and the compact five-dimension JSON — see [Badge & JSON API](#badge--json-api).

### Structured result sample

```json
{
  "schema": "dsh-score/v1",
  "scoreId": "sc_8f1c2e4a9b3d7f01",
  "target": { "kind": "repo", "spec": "github:owner/dsh-click#abc123" },
  "scoredAt": "2026-08-16T00:00:00.000Z",
  "durationMs": 3210,
  "pluginVersion": "0.2.11",
  "dimensions": {
    "install": { "dimension": "install", "status": "no-evidence", "score": 0, "weight": 25,
                 "summary": "no dsh-test-drive result recorded for this target (install success unmeasured)",
                 "evidence": [{ "source": "test-drive", "detail": "no test-drive record found in the test_drive domain", "observedAt": "2026-08-16T00:00:00.000Z" }] },
    "maintenance": { "dimension": "maintenance", "status": "pass", "score": 100, "weight": 20,
                     "summary": "active (2026-08-10T00:00:00Z; 0 open issues)",
                     "evidence": [{ "source": "gh-api", "detail": "last activity 2026-08-10T00:00:00Z", "observedAt": "2026-08-16T00:00:00.000Z" }] }
  },
  "total": 88,
  "grade": "B",
  "verdict": "healthy (weighted total 88/100)"
}
```

Scoring: the total is a weighted average over dimensions that gathered evidence (no-evidence dimensions are excluded and renormalized); `A` ≥ 90, `B` ≥ 75, `C` ≥ 60, `D` ≥ 40, else `F`, and `N/A` when nothing had evidence.

## Badge & JSON API

`score_badge` generates an embeddable README badge and the five-dimension JSON for one scored target.

### Badge

Three forms, all derived from the same settled score card:

- **Endpoint** — a documented [shields.io](https://shields.io) static URL, paste-ready for a README image (zero self-hosting).
- **SVG** — a self-contained shields.io flat-style SVG (`badge.svg` field / `renderScoreBadge`) for offline or self-hosted READMEs.
- **Markdown** — the embed snippet combining both.

Embed the total badge in any README:

```markdown
![dsh-score: B · 84/100](https://img.shields.io/badge/dsh--score-B_%C2%B7_84%2F100-green)
```

### Five-dimension JSON

The same call returns the compact JSON API envelope (`schema: "dsh-score/badge/v1"`):

```json
{
  "schema": "dsh-score/badge/v1",
  "target": { "kind": "repo", "spec": "github:owner/dsh-click#abc123" },
  "scoredAt": "2026-08-16T00:00:00.000Z",
  "total": 84,
  "grade": "B",
  "dimensions": {
    "install":      { "label": "install", "status": "no-evidence", "score": 0,  "weight": 25, "summary": "no dsh-test-drive result recorded" },
    "maintenance":  { "label": "maintenance", "status": "pass", "score": 90, "weight": 20, "summary": "active (0 open issues)" },
    "documentation": { "label": "docs", "status": "pass", "score": 85, "weight": 20, "summary": "README + CHANGELOG + SECURITY" },
    "security":     { "label": "security", "status": "warn", "score": 60, "weight": 20, "summary": "permissive license" },
    "compliance":   { "label": "compliance", "status": "pass", "score": 100, "weight": 15, "summary": "dsh.bundle.patch + dsh-plugin topic" }
  }
}
```

A `no-evidence` dimension keeps its honest status and score 0 — the badge and JSON never fabricate a number.

## Permissions & data

- Only public services are consumed: `ctx.subprocess`, `ctx.jobs`, `ctx.storageDomain`, `ctx.tools`, `ctx.commands`.
- Score cards and leaderboards are stored in the `score` storage-domain (tables `scores`, `leaderboards`; latest-leaderboard pointer). When the composition has no `storageDomain` (profiles that predate the base bundle's storage rows, such as the `0.1.1-rc.2`-era headless profile), tools still work and score persistence is disabled with a logged reason. The published `dsh-base` bundle mounts storage-domain from `0.1.2-rc.1` on (verified against the `0.1.2-rc.1` and `0.1.5-alpha.1` tarballs), so persistence is active on the published line.
0.1.2-rc.1 (adapted 2026-09-04) and 0.1.5-rc.2: the session envelope keeps its ignorable field for stored-log read compatibility only - Session.append still cannot stamp it, so audit-gate behavior is unchanged.
- Child processes inherit the provider's credential-scrubbed environment; `gh` reads its own credential store. No environment value is ever logged.
- All report/log strings pass through pure sanitizers: token literals, URL credentials, and bearer headers are redacted, and tails are byte-capped.

## Security boundaries

- **No code execution.** The pipeline runs `gh api` and `npm view` only; it never installs, builds, or runs a target.
- **Argv-only subprocesses.** Every CLI invocation is an argv array, never shell-interpreted; repo owner/repo segments are validated against a restricted character set before use in an endpoint.
- **Evidence discipline.** No score is fabricated: a probe that fails or returns unparsable output yields `no-evidence`, never a number.
- **Detection vs redaction.** Secret-leak and malicious-install-script detection share the same pure regexes as redaction; both are unit-tested against extreme inputs.

## Known limitations

- Repository probes require `gh` to be authenticated and network access to GitHub; npm probes require `npm` and registry access.
- A target without a resolvable GitHub repository cannot be inspected for documentation, security, or compliance (those dimensions report `no-evidence`).
- Install success depends on `dsh-test-drive` being mounted and having recorded the target; otherwise it is honestly `no-evidence`.
- The maintenance "issue response" signal is a proxy (oldest open issue age), not a direct response-time measurement.
- Score results are cached per target; use `refresh: true` (or wait past `cacheMaxAgeMs`) to force re-scoring.

## Development

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run typecheck && pnpm run typecheck:ci && pnpm test
pnpm run build && pnpm run verify:self-contained && pnpm run verify:artifacts && pnpm pack
```

- `typecheck` resolves `@deepseek-ai/*` through the local harness checkout; `typecheck:ci` checks against the published `0.1.5-rc.2` types.
- Tests use the real `Context`/`Session`/`ToolRuntime`/`LocalJobRegistry`/storage stack with a scripted subprocess provider.
- Real-CLI scoring (requires `gh`/`npm` on PATH, `gh` authenticated): invoke `score` from a mounted profile.
- Release: `node scripts/release.mjs <x.y.z>` (bumps, stamps CHANGELOG, re-runs the gate, commits + tags; never pushes).
