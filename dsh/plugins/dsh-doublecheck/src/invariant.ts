/**
 * Package-owned invariant companion for dsh-doublecheck.
 *
 * Three post-commit diagnostic checks over the events this package's write
 * paths produce (all three target events are committed before dispatch, so a
 * violation is reported — via the host registry's `fail` — rather than
 * vetoed):
 *
 * 1. Every `doublecheck/spec` announcement carries six non-empty spec fields.
 * 2. Every `doublecheck/report` announcement's verdict is consistent with the
 *    log re-derivation. When verification did not run, the two must be equal;
 *    when verification ran, a failing check must report `challenged` and a
 *    clean one must report `proven` or `unverified` (the `complete` fact rides
 *    the tool result, not this event, so equality is not checkable there).
 * 3. Every `doublecheck/review` announcement's findings satisfy the
 *    structured finding shape (severity enum, non-empty title and detail).
 * 4. Every `doublecheck/gate` announcement's verdict matches the re-derivation
 *    from its own phase results, and all four phases are present.
 *
 * The guard registers a facts-bearing installer from its own context; the
 * `./invariant` export is the standalone companion usable through a separate
 * profile row.
 * @module dsh-doublecheck/invariant
