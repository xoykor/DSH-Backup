/**
 * The delivery gate runner: orchestrates the four-phase quality checklist
 * over one session's durable evidence and settles the deliverable/rework
 * decision.
 *
 * - **requirements** + **tests** — deterministic folds of the session log
 *   (no model calls): the key-question checklist against the committed
 *   spec, and the test-run/coverage evidence.
 * - **consistency** — a local forked reviewer audits the diff ↔ requirement
 *   mapping (every edit must serve a spec dimension).
 * - **review** — the delivery conclusion. With `engine: auto`, the
 *   dsh-auto-review engine's durable verdict records (`autoReview/verdict` /
 *   `autoReview/rejection`) are the evidence; when the engine is not
 *   installed or has no records this session, the phase degrades to the
 *   local forked reviewer and says so. `engine: local` always uses the
 *   local reviewer. The gate never synthesizes approval requests: that
 *   chain may reach a human.
 *
 * Everything a run settles is audit-safe: counts, ids, verdicts, and
 * redacted findings only. The settled state rides the durable
 * `doublecheck/gate` session event (replay IS the state), the workspace
 * `gate-report.md`, and the `/gate run` command result.
 *
