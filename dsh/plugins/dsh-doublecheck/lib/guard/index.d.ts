/**
 * The discipline guard: dsh-doublecheck's soft enforcement plugin.
 *
 * Two gates compose on the documented `tools/pre-execute` /
 * `tools/post-execute` / `agent/turn-stopping` extension points, both reading
 * their facts from the durable session log alone:
 *
 * - **Grill gate** (`modules.grill`): a vague task with no committed
 *   `doublecheck_spec` may not mutate implementation files.
 * - **Red/green gate** (`modules.tdd`, v0.2): an implementation edit requires
 *   a failing test run on record since the last passing run (the red step);
 *   at turn end, edits without a passing run re-arm the green reminder.
 *   Writing test files is always allowed — that is how the red step happens.
 *
 * The configured `intensity` picks the consequence for both gates:
 *
 * - `remind`: the call proceeds; a reminder rides the call's
 *   `additionalContexts`, so the agent loop records it as a `user/message`
 *   session event (model-visible ⟺ logged).
 * - `warn`: the call is held for human approval through the approval seam
 *   (`ask`); without an approval channel it denies.
 * - `block`: the call is denied with corrective feedback.
 *
 * Resumed and forked sessions enforce identically. The package-internal
 * `doublecheck/reminder` event announces each reaction for observers.
 *
 * @module dsh-doublecheck/guard
