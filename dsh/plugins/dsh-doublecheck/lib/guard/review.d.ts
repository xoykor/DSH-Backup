/**
 * Adversary review: a forked critic subagent audits the delivery against the
 * committed spec.
 *
 * The critic is a one-shot `ctx.subagents` run on the configured provider
 * (default `fork`): the child inherits the parent session's completed-turn
 * prefix, so it sees the `doublecheck_spec` record, the red/green test
 * evidence, and every edit without any extra plumbing. A structured output
 * schema forces the findings shape; `agentOptions.model` routes the critic to
 * `adversaryModel` when one is configured. The critic may read (never mutate)
 * through an explicit tool allowlist.
