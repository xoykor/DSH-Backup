 * Task-vagueness detection for the discipline guard.
 *
 * A task is "vague" when it is brief and names no concrete artifact. Brief is
 * a deployment knob (`vagueTaskMaxChars`); artifact detection is a fixed
 * structural test: a file extension token, a drive-letter prefix, a
 * path-separator token, a quoted keyword, an underscore keyword, or a
 * hyphenated keyword. A task that names an artifact (or a URL) is concrete
 * enough to edit without a grill even when it is short; a long task is
 * assumed to carry its own requirements.
 *
