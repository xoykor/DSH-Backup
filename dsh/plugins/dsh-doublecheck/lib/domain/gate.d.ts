/**
 * The delivery gate domain: the configurable quality-gate checklist that
 * turns one session's durable evidence into a deliverable/rework decision.
 *
 * Four phases compose the checklist:
 *
 * - **requirements** — a key-question checklist confirmed item by item
 *   against the committed spec (deterministic fold, no model calls).
 * - **tests** — test evidence from the session log: the latest run color,
 *   failing runs after green, and (optionally) a coverage percentage parsed
 *   from the test output.
 * - **consistency** — diff ↔ requirement mapping, audited by a local forked
 *   reviewer (orchestrated by the guard row; this module owns the result
 *   shape and the status fold).
 * - **review** — the delivery conclusion: the dsh-auto-review engine's
 *   durable verdict records when they exist (`engine: auto`), degraded to
 *   the local reviewer when the engine is not installed or has not run.
 *
 * Everything here is pure: the durable session log in, structured gate facts
 * out. Check summaries and suggestions are stable English audit ids (the
 * workspace documents keep English headings by package policy); the guard
 * row localizes the surrounding command chrome. Reports are audit-safe by
 * construction — counts, ids, and verdicts only — and {@link redactSecrets}
 * scrubs the model-produced finding texts before they are stored or shown.
 *
