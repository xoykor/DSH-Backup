/**
 * The dsh-doublecheck discipline state machine.
 *
 * Six stages: `grill` (settle requirements) → `design` (spec committed) →
 * `red` (failing test) → `green` (passing test) → `review` (self-review) →
 * `verify` (delivery proof). v0.1 implemented the first transition; v0.2 adds
 * the red/green evidence transitions folded from durable test-run records.
 *
 * The state derives from the session log, never from process memory: a
 * `doublecheck_spec` call with a successful result advances past `grill`, a
 * failing test run marks `red`, a passing run marks `green`, and any
 * implementation edit after the latest passing run re-arms the green gate.
 * Resumed and forked sessions fold to the same state as the live run.
