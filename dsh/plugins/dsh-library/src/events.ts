/**
 * Session audit events for dsh-library (declaration merging into the harness's
 * `SessionEventMap`) and the adaptive append gate. Both events are log-only;
 * tool arguments and rendered results are already logged by the tool runtime
 * as `tool/call` + `tool/result`, and these events carry the audit facts that
 * exist outside them: the inject id linking the injected marker text back to
 * the search that produced it, and each purge-verification verdict.
 *
 * The gate appends only when the host can carry the events safely:
 * - hosts whose known-type set covers the vocabulary append plainly;
 * - hosts with an `ignorable` append option (pre-0.1.2 master builds) append
 *   with the marker, so builds that do not know the type skip it on restore;
 * - envelope-less hosts (0.1.0-rc.6/rc.8, 0.1.1-rc.2, and 0.1.2-alpha.3,
 *   which fails closed on unknown types at read) get no append — the tool
 *   results remain the reconstructable audit trail. On 0.1.2-alpha.3 the envelope field is restored for stored-log read compatibility only - its Session.append still cannot stamp the marker, so the gate behavior is unchanged.
 *
