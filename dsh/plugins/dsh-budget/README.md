## Compatibility

| Surface | Status |
|---|---|
| Harness | DeepSeek Harness `dsh-v0.1.5-rc.2` (GitHub tag, verified 2026-09-11; npm pin `0.1.5-rc.2` adapted 2026-09-10; peer range `>=0.1.2-rc.1 <0.2.0 || >=0.1.5-alpha.1 <0.2.0`): the session envelope keeps its ignorable field for stored-log read compatibility only - Session.append still cannot stamp it, so audit-gate behavior is unchanged. Verified 2026-09-11 against the dsh-v0.1.5-rc.2 master checkout (full local gate chain; the profile install smoke runs in the monthly Compat workflow). |

| Audit events | Written on harnesses before `0.1.2-rc.1`; suppressed with a logged degradation reason on `0.1.2-rc.1` and later (fail-closed session event vocabulary, no external registration surface) || Node | `^22.19.0 \|\| >=24.0.0` |
| Surfaces | Host + Web client (Settings budget tab); `/budget` command |

## What you get

`dsh-budget` turns the session event stream into a four-in-one cost governance loop:

- **Aggregated metering** — tokens (uncached input / output / cache read / cache write), estimated USD cost, and carbon footprint per model, session, and day, priced through a built-in USD-per-1M table merged with your `config.prices`.
- **Budget governance** — session/daily/monthly caps; a warn-ratio threshold alert (webhook POST + desktop-notification flag) and three over-limit policies: `alert` (notify only), `block` (short-circuit new model requests until the user lifts the block), `degrade` (block with corrective guidance naming the cheaper model from your `degradation` map).
- **Carbon & latency** — token→carbon bridge (tokens × kWh/token × PUE × regional grid intensity, ported from AI-Carbon-Footprint-Calculator) and per-model latency percentiles.
- **Surfaces** — the Settings budget tab (usage bars, per-day usage curve, model breakdown, alerts, cap editors, unblock buttons) and the `/budget` command (`/budget`, `/budget models`, `/budget unblock <scope>`).

## Quick start

```sh
# 1. install the bundle into your profile
dsh plugin --profile web add "github:PerryLink/dsh-budget#main"

# or from npm (published releases)
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-budget

# 2. restart and verify the row
dsh --profile web --dump-config | grep -A2 'id: budget'
```

Then ask the agent: `/budget` — and watch the Settings tab fill in.

## Install & uninstall

- **git channel** (latest `main`): `dsh plugin --profile web add "github:PerryLink/dsh-budget#main"` — the `prepare` script builds with production dependencies only.
- **npm channel** (published releases): `dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-budget`.
- **tarball channel**: `pnpm pack` in this repo, then `dsh plugin --profile web add ./dsh-budget-<version>.tgz`.
- **uninstall**: `dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-budget`.

> If pnpm reports `ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS` for this package (esbuild's harmless platform-binary validation), add `allowBuilds: { esbuild: true }` to your `pnpm-workspace.yaml` — the `dsh` CLI prints the exact snippet.

## Configuration

All tunables are Schemastery `Config` fields (changeable from cordis.yml). `cordis.patch.yml` documents each key inline.

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `prices` | `{}` | Per-model USD prices per 1M tokens, merged over the built-in table |
| `defaultPrice` | `{input: 1.0, output: 3.0}` | Fallback for models absent from both tables |
| `budgets.session` / `daily` / `monthly` | `10` / `50` / `500` | Budget caps in USD per scope; omit for unlimited |
| `warnRatio` | `0.8` | Alert once usage reaches this fraction of a cap (0..1) |
| `overLimit` | `alert` | `alert` / `block` / `degrade` after a cap is crossed |
| `degradation` | `{}` | Model id → cheaper model id of the same provider |
| `webhookUrl` | *(none)* | Optional webhook URL for threshold alerts (POST JSON) |
| `webhookTimeoutMs` | `5000` | Webhook request timeout |
| `alertsEnabled` | `true` | Master switch for threshold alerts |
| `alertCooldownMs` | `3600000` | Minimum ms between two alerts of the same scope |
| `desktopNotifications` | `false` | Browser desktop notifications while the tab is open |
| `refreshIntervalMs` | `5000` | Settings tab polling interval |
| `carbon.enabled` / `region` / `pue` / `energyKwhPerToken` | `true` / `global` / `1.58` / `0.000007` | Carbon bridge (regions: global, us, eu, china, india, uk, france, iceland) |
| `latency.enabled` / `windowSize` | `true` / `200` | Per-model latency percentiles and their window |
| `currency` | `{code: USD, rate: 1.0, decimals: 2}` | Display currency (costs are computed in USD) |
| `outputLanguage` | `en` | `/budget` output language: `en` / `zh` |
| `historyDays` | `30` | Per-day usage history kept in the panel snapshot |
| `persistence.enabled` / `intervalMs` | `true` / `10000` | Durable day/month persistence across restarts (storage domain); degrades to in-memory when the domain is absent |

## Tools & surfaces

| Surface | Kind | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `/budget` | Command | Per-scope overview (usage, ratio, carbon, blocked state) |
| `/budget models` | Command | Per-model breakdown with latency percentiles |
| `/budget unblock <scope>` | Command | Lift a blocked scope (`session` / `daily` / `monthly`) |
| Settings → Plugins → Budget | Settings tab | Usage bars, per-day usage curve, model breakdown, alerts, cap editors, unblock buttons |
| `budget/status`, `budget/setSettings`, `budget/unblock` | Typert Remote | The client channel (the tab consumes these) |

## Permissions & data

- **Permissions**: `network:outbound` (the optional alert webhook only), `session:append` (audit events), `native-code:none`.
- **Data**: everything displayed comes from the session event stream; the only host-side network call is the configured webhook, whose URL is validated at load and credential-stripped before any log. No prompts or payloads ever leave the host.
- **Session log**: `budget/alert` and `budget/block` are log-only audit events carrying scope names and USD amounts (microtask-deferred past the session-append reentrancy guard). On harnesses `0.1.2-rc.1` and later they are not written — the fail-closed event vocabulary rejects logs with unregistered event types and offers no external registration surface — so the audit trail degrades to the budget logger and webhook only.

## Security boundaries

- **No fabrication**: a budget block yields a corrective error finish on the `llm/stream` waterfall — the plugin never invents model output.
- **No request rewriting**: loop-built requests are frozen; `degrade` therefore names the target model in the corrective message instead of swapping the request.
- **Fail loud**: invalid prices, URLs, ratios, regions, and bounds fail the mount.
- **Honest scope**: runtime edits from the panel are session-scoped; a reload restores the cordis.yml values.

## Known limitations

- Aggregation is process-local: usage resets when the harness restarts (per-day/per-month buckets rebuild from the current session log view).
- `block`/`degrade` rely on the `llm/stream` waterfall; harness builds without that seam cannot block requests (alerts still work).
- Built-in prices drift; override entries via `config.prices`.

## Development

```sh
pnpm install        # node ^22.19 || >=24
pnpm run typecheck  # tsc: src + tests against the local harness checkout
pnpm run typecheck:ci  # tsc against the published 0.1.5-rc.2 types (no paths)
pnpm test           # vitest
pnpm run build      # tsc declarations + tsdown bundles (lib/)
pnpm run verify:self-contained  # dependency specs resolve from the registry
pnpm run verify:artifacts       # built ESM face + typert manifest + client bundle
pnpm pack           # the published tarball
```
