## Compatibility

| Surface | Status |
|---|---|
| Harness | Main version **`dsh-v0.1.5-rc.2`** (GitHub tag, verified 2026-09-11: full gate chain + profile install smoke). npm dependency line pinned to `0.1.5-rc.2`; peers `>=0.1.2-rc.1 <0.2.0 || >=0.1.5-alpha.1 <0.2.0`. |
| Node | `^22.19.0 \|\| >=24.0.0` |
| Form | Pure-host JS plugin (no browser half) |
| Model | Any model — repair is deterministic, no extra model calls |

## What you get

Two independent surfaces, one bundle:

- **`/translate`** — the vendor parameter translation table: `temperature`, `top_p`, `max_tokens`, `stop`, `system`, and 8 more canonical parameters mapped across **11 vendors** (OpenAI, ERNIE, Qwen, Anthropic, Google, DeepSeek, Mistral, Cohere, xAI, Groq, Azure). Ask for a pairwise mapping, list vendors/params, or convert a whole standard request (`transformRequest` in `lib/rosetta.mjs`).
- **The repair layer** — a `tools/post-execute` listener plus the `fix_json` tool. When a successful tool result carries broken JSON as a string (string-rooted or `json`-rooted output schema, or a tool opted in by name), the layer repairs it deterministically: markdown-fence extraction, escape repair, trailing-comma removal, truncation closure, and required-field completion with explicit `null` placeholders. **No value is ever invented** — a result that still violates the schema fails closed, and failed tool results are never flipped into successes.

```text
tool result (success, JSON text) ──▶ extract fence ──▶ parse
    │ ok? ──▶ schema-validate ──▶ accept { kind: 'accept', value }  (registry re-validates + re-renders)
    │ broken ──▶ escape / trailing-comma / close / fill-null ──▶ validate
    │ unrepairable ──▶ next()  (original value preserved) + translate/fix audit (counts only)
```

## Quick start

```sh
# 1. install the bundle into your profile
dsh plugin --profile web add "github:PerryLink/dsh-translate#main"

# or from npm (published releases)
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-translate

# 2. restart and verify the row
dsh --profile web --dump-config | grep -A2 'id: dsh-translate'
```

Then ask the agent to check a mapping or repair a payload:

```
> /translate openai ernie max_tokens
> Use fix_json to repair: {"a": 1,} against {"type":"object","properties":{"a":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["a"]}
```

## Install & uninstall

- **git channel** (latest `main`): `dsh plugin --profile web add "github:PerryLink/dsh-translate#main"` — pure JS, no build step.
- **npm channel** (published releases): `dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-translate`.
- **tarball channel**: `pnpm pack` in this repo, then `dsh plugin --profile web add ./dsh-translate-<version>.tgz`.
- **uninstall**: `dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-translate` (or remove the row from the profile patch).

## Configuration

All tunables are Schemastery `Config` fields (changeable from cordis.yml). An id-targeted override replaces the whole row — restate every key you need. `cordis.patch.yml` documents each key inline.

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `true` | Master switch; `false` registers nothing |
| `repair.enabled` | `true` | Post-execute repair layer switch |
| `repair.toolNames` | `[]` | Extra tool names whose JSON-text results may be repaired (on top of string-rooted / `json`-rooted schemas) |
| `repair.strategies.escapeRepair` | `true` | Escape raw control characters inside strings |
| `repair.strategies.trailingComma` | `true` | Remove commas directly before a closing bracket |
| `repair.strategies.truncationClosure` | `true` | Close an unclosed string or container cut off by truncation |
| `repair.strategies.fieldCompletion` | `true` | Complete missing required fields with explicit `null` placeholders |
| `repair.maxSteps` | `8` | Strategy application budget (repair-loop passes, 1..64) |
| `diffMaxChars` | `200` | Cap on one logged diff fragment, in characters |
| `diffMaxEntries` | `50` | Cap on logged diff entries |
| `registerCommand` | `true` | Register the `/translate` command |
| `registerTool` | `true` | Register the `fix_json` tool |
| `rosettaDataPath` | *(none)* | Optional external rosetta data file (same shape as the bundled `lib/rosetta-data.json`); overrides the built-in mapping table |

Example override in your profile patch:

```yaml
- insert:
    - id: dsh-translate
      name: dsh-translate
      config:
        enabled: true
        repair:
          enabled: true
          toolNames: ['emit-json']
          strategies:
            escapeRepair: true
            trailingComma: true
            truncationClosure: true
            fieldCompletion: true
          maxSteps: 8
        diffMaxChars: 200
        diffMaxEntries: 50
        registerCommand: true
        registerTool: true
```

## Tools & surfaces

| Surface | Kind | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `/translate` | command | `vendors`, `params`, or `<from> <to> [param]` pairwise mapping |
| `fix_json` | tool | `{ text, schema?, strategies? }` → `{ ok, repaired?, diff?, strategies, truncated, validated, error? }`; diff fragments are bounded and sanitized |
| post-execute repair | listener | Automatic for successful string results from string-rooted / `json`-rooted schemas (plus `repair.toolNames`); always calls `next()` unless it claims the call |

## Permissions & data

- **Permissions**: no network, no subprocess, no credentials — the plugin only consumes the official `commands` and `tools` services and appends to the session log.
- **Data**: repair never fabricates values; the only model-visible additions are the repaired canonical value and the `fix_json` diff. Session audit events (`translate/fix`) carry tool name, call id, strategy names, edit counts, and truncation flags — never payloads. The audit write is gated by the host’s session-event vocabulary: hosts that know `translate/fix` get the plain two-argument append, hosts with the `ignorable` append envelope get the marked append, and envelope-less hosts (`0.1.0-rc.6`–`0.1.1-rc.2`, `0.1.2-rc.1`) get no audit append — the tool result remains the model-visible log.
0.1.2-rc.1 (adapted 2026-09-04): the session envelope keeps its ignorable field for stored-log read compatibility only - Session.append still cannot stamp it, so audit-gate behavior is unchanged.

## Security boundaries

- **Deterministic only.** Repair is bounded text surgery; the upstream LLM-retry arm of JSON-Schema-Enforcer-Proxy was deliberately not ported — a post-execute listener never calls a model.
- **Fail closed.** Unrepairable syntax and schema violations leave the original result untouched (or return a structured error from `fix_json`); `null` placeholders only land when the schema accepts `null`.
- **Hostile input bounded.** Unsupported schema keywords and circular schemas are rejected; `oneOf` validation is capped by depth (`MAX_ONE_OF_DEPTH`) and a branch budget (`MAX_ONE_OF_BUDGET`), so an exponential schema cannot exhaust the process.
- **No payload leakage.** Logs and audit events never contain repaired payloads; diffs are truncated and capped before display or storage.

## Known limitations

- The supported JSON Schema subset mirrors the harness tool registry (`type`/`oneOf`/`properties`/`required`/`additionalProperties`/`items`/`enum`/`const`); other keywords are rejected as unsupported, not silently ignored.
- Repair only applies to successful results whose canonical value is a JSON-text string; a value that already failed schema validation arrives as a failed result and is never flipped.
- The translation table covers 11 vendors × 13 canonical parameters; `extended` rows follow public API references (not the upstream trio) and are marked as such in `lib/rosetta.mjs`.
- On hosts that neither know `translate/fix` nor expose the `ignorable` append envelope — the published `0.1.0-rc.6`–`0.1.1-rc.2` line and `0.1.2-rc.1`, which fails closed on unknown event types at read — the adaptive gate skips the audit append so the session log is never polluted; the in-log audit mirror is lost on those hosts until the event type is registered.

## Development
